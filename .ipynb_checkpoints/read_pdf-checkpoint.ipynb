The sole authoritative text is \\nthe original German. \\n\\n \\n \\nBanking statistics guidelines and customer classification,   \\nSection “MFI interest rate statistics” \\n \\n \\nFinal version: July 2017 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPage 1 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\nGuidelines on MFI interest rate statistics \\n \\n \\nI. Focus of the survey and definitions \\n \\nThe survey focuses on the interest rates applied in Germany by domestic banks (MFIs) to euro-\\ndenominated deposits and loans vis-à-vis households and non-financial corporations domiciled \\nin  euro  member  states. The  interest  rate  statistical  data are  collected  for  outstanding  amounts \\nand new business for the instrument categories defined in the reporting schemes ZA and ZB.  \\n \\nHouseholds  and  non-financial  corporations  include  all  non-financial  sectors  except  for \\ngeneral government according to European System of Accounts (ESA) 20101. For the purposes \\nof  these statistics,  households  are  summarised  in  detail  under the  ESA  sectors  \"Households” \\n(S.14) and “Non-profit institutions serving households” (S.15), while non-financial corporations \\ncorrespond to the ESA sector S.11.  \\n \\nThe  ESA  sector  “Households”  is  identical  to  the  definition  of  “Households”  in  the  monthly \\nbalance sheet statistics, and also includes sole proprietors.2 According to ESA 2010, non-profit \\ninstitutions  serving  households  consist  of  “non-profit  institutions  which  are  separate  legal \\nentities,  which  serve  households,  and  which  are  private  other  non-market  producers.  Their \\nprincipal resources, apart from those derived from occasional sales, are derived from voluntary \\ncontributions in cash or in kind from households in their capacity as consumers, from payments \\nmade by general government3 and from property income.” This category includes, for example, \\nchurches,  political  parties,  professional  associations  and  research  organisations,  sport  and \\nleisure  associations,  trade  unions  and  charitable  organisations.  According  to  ESA  2010,  non-\\nfinancial  corporations  include  all  enterprises  (including  partnerships)  other  than  banks, \\ninsurance  corporations  and  other  financial  institutions;  in  the  monthly  balance  sheet  statistics, \\nthey are referred to as other enterprises.  \\n \\nFor enterprises see general guidelines on monthly balance sheet statistics number 20 \\n \\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n1 Included in Annex A of Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 \\n\\non the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (ABl. L 174, 26 June 2013).  \\n2 In Regulation ECB/2013/34 also called sole proprietorship and partnerships without legal status (accordingly, sec-\\ntion 2.119d of ESA 2010). See also statistics guideline 2 - customer classification, II. 2. a) Self-employed persons \\n(including sole proprietorships) \\n\\n3 NPIs controlled and mainly financed by general government are classified in the general government sector (see \\n\\nsection 2.140c of ESA 2010). \\n\\nPage 2 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\nII. Explanatory notes on the reporting system \\n \\n1 Type of interest rate to be reported \\n \\na) Annualised agreed rate and narrowly defined effective rate  \\n \\nEither the annualised agreed rate (AAR) or the narrowly defined effective rate (NDER) is to \\nbe reported for positions 01 to 26 of reporting scheme ZA and for positions 01 to 23 and 32 to 91 \\nof  reporting  scheme  ZB.  The  only  difference  between  these  calculation  methods  is  their \\nunderlying process of annualising interest payments. While the AAR is based on a formula that \\ncan  only  be  applied  to  deposits  and  loans  with  regular  capitalisation  of  interest  payment,  the \\nNDER is calculated iteratively, and can therefore be applied to all types of deposits and loans.  \\n \\nBoth  calculation  methods  cover  all  interest  payments  on  deposits  and  loans  but  no  other \\ncharges  that  may  apply,  such  as  the  costs  for  inquiries,  administration,  preparation  of \\ndocuments,  guarantees  and  credit  insurance.  If  a  disagio  has  been  agreed,  this  is  to  be \\nconsidered as an interest payment at the start of the contract (time t0). A disagio is defined as \\nthe  difference  between  the  nominal  amount  of  the  loan  and  the  amount  received  by  the \\ncustomer.  An  agio,  the  opposite  of  a  disagio,  should  also  be  considered  in  the  interest  rate \\nstatistics.  Loan  fees  for  unused  current  account  credit  lines,  as  well  as  commitment  fees  for \\ngranted but unused credit lines, are not to be included in the AAR / NDER calculation.  \\n \\nIn principle, the interest payments covered in the AAR / NDER reflect what the reporting agent \\npays  on  deposits  and  receives  for  loans.  If  there  is  a  discrepancy  between  the  amount  that  a \\ncontracting party pays and that which another party receives, the point of view of the reporting \\nagent is decisive. In compliance with this principle, the interest rates are recorded on a gross \\nbasis  before  tax,  since  the  pre-tax  interest  rate  reflects  what  the  reporting  agent  pays  on \\ndeposits  and receives for  loans.  In  addition,  subsidies  granted  to  households  or  non-financial \\ncorporations by third parties are not taken into account when determining the interest payment, \\nbecause  the  subsidies  are  not  paid  or  received  by  the  reporting  agent.  If,  for  example,  a \\nreporting  agent  charges  10%  interest  p.a.  for  a  loan,  but  only  6%  p.a.  is  to  be  paid  by  the \\nborrowing customer, with a third party paying the other 4% p.a. as a subsidy, then the interest \\nrate  statistics  covers  an  interest  rate  of  10%  p.a.  This  is  regardless  of  whether  the  subsidy \\nprovider makes payments to the customer directly or via the reporting agent. Consequently, only \\nthe interest components which the reporting institution charges as interest will be included in the \\ninterest  rate  statistics,  and  not  the  part  which  the  borrower  pays  to  the  reporting  agent. \\nAccordingly  the  governmental  incentive  for  a  deposit  under  a  savings  and  loan  contract,  for \\nexample, is not included in the interest rate calculation.   \\n \\nFavourable  interest  rates  that  reporting  agents  apply  to  their  employees  are  covered  in  the \\ninterest  rate  statistics.  Where  regulatory  arrangements  are  in  place,  for  example  interest  rate \\nceilings and restrictions, these are reflected in the interest rate statistics. Therefore, any change \\nin  the  rules  determining  regulatory  arrangements  is  shown  in  the  interest  rate  statistics  as  a \\nchange in the interest rate. \\n \\nInterest bearing as well as non-interest bearing deposits and loans are to be reported in the in-\\nterest  rate  statistics.  Any  contractually  agreed  negative  interest  rates  are  also  in  the  scope  of \\nMFI interest rate statistics.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPage 3 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\n \\nReporting  agents  apply  a  standard  year  of  365  days  for  the  compilation  of  the  AAR,  i.e.  the \\neffect of an additional day in leap years is ignored. The interest rates are to be specified to  no \\nless than two, but no more than four, decimal places.   \\n \\nAnnualised agreed rate (AAR) \\n\\nThe AAR is defined as the interest rate that is individually agreed between the reporting agent \\nand the household or non-financial corporation for a deposit or loan, converted to an annual ba-\\nsis  and  quoted  in  percentages  per  annum.  If  interest  payments  agreed  between  the  reporting \\nagent and the household or non-financial corporation are capitalised at regular intervals within a \\nyear, the agreed rate is annualised by means of the following formula to derive the AAR: \\n\\n, \\n\\n \\nwhere \\nx  \\nrag \\n\\nn \\n\\nis the AAR, \\nis  the  interest  rate  per  annum  that  is  agreed  between  the  reporting  agent  and  the \\nhousehold  or  non-financial  corporation  on  a  deposit  or  loan,  whereby  the  interest \\ncapitalisation  for  the  deposit  and  all  payments  and  repayments  related  to  the  loan  takes \\nplace at regular intervals within one year, and \\nis the number of interest capitalisation periods for the deposit and (re)payment periods for \\nthe  loan  per  year,  i.e.  “1”  for  yearly  payments,  “2”  for  semi-annual  payments,  “4”  for \\nquarterly payments and “12” for monthly payments. \\n\\n \\nIn those cases in which the frequency of repayments and interest payments do not match, the \\nrate of interest capitalisations is used for calculating the AAR.  \\n \\n \\nExample 1: Calculating the AAR \\n \\n1.1  An interest rate of 10% is agreed upon for a €10,000 loan with a maturity of 5 years. The \\n\\ninterest is capitalised quarterly. Thus, the AAR is  \\n\\n \\n1.2  An interest rate of 10% is agreed upon for a loan with a maturity of 5 years. The interest is \\n\\ncapitalised annually. This results in an AAR of 0.1, i.e. 10%. \\n\\n \\n1.3  An interest rate of 10% is agreed upon for a loan with a maturity of 5 years. The interest is \\n\\nonly capitalised after 5 years at the end of the loan\\'s maturity. Thus, the AAR is  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPage 4 of 20 \\n\\n11\\uf02d\\uf0f7\\uf0f7\\uf0f8\\uf0f6\\uf0e7\\uf0e7\\uf0e8\\uf0e6\\uf02b\\uf03dnagnrx%.3813.1010381289.0141.014\\uf03d\\uf03d\\uf02d\\uf0f7\\uf0f8\\uf0f6\\uf0e7\\uf0e8\\uf0e6\\uf02b\\uf03dx%.4472.8084471771.01511.0151\\uf03d\\uf03d\\uf02d\\uf0f7\\uf0f7\\uf0f7\\uf0f7\\uf0f8\\uf0f6\\uf0e7\\uf0e7\\uf0e7\\uf0e7\\uf0e8\\uf0e6\\uf02b\\uf03dx\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\n \\n1.4  An interest rate of 10% is agreed upon for a €10,000 loan with a maturity of 5 years. The \\ninterest is capitalised quarterly. The loan amount is disbursed minus a discount (disagio) of \\n2%. Thus, the AAR is \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nNarrowly defined effective rate (NDER) \\n \\nThe  NDER  is  the  interest  rate  which,  on  an  annual  basis,  equalises  the  present  values  of  all \\ncommitments (deposits or loans, payments or repayments, interest payments), future or existing, \\nagreed  between  the  reporting  agent  and  the  household  or  non-financial  corporation.  It  is  in \\naccordance with the definition in article 3 (i) of the European Parliament and Council’s guideline \\n2008/48/EC from 23 April 2008 concerning consumer loan agreements and the repealing of the \\nCouncil\\'s  guideline  87/102/EEC.4  The  NDER  corresponds  with  the  effective  interest  rate’s \\ninterest components. The NDER formula is shown in the following example. \\n \\n \\nExample 2: Calculating the NDER \\n \\nAn interest rate of 10% is agreed upon for a €10,000 loan with a maturity of 5 years.

The  annual  percentage rate of \\ncharge  (APRC)  covers  the  “total  cost  of  the  credit  to  the  consumer”.  The  total  costs \\ncomprise an interest rate component (which is identical to the NDER)5 and a component for all \\nother  charges,  such  as  costs  for  inquiries,  administration,  preparation  of  the  documents, \\nguarantees  and  credit  insurance.  Commitment  fees  are  not  to  be  included  in  the  APRC \\n\\n                                                 \\n5 Concerning the reporting of subsidies see section II.

However, all transactions from items 16 to 19 of  scheme ZB are to be included in the \\ncalculation  of  the  overall  position’s  reporting  value  “housing  loans  to  households”  (item  31  of \\nscheme ZB). \\n \\n \\n2. Business coverage \\n \\na) Interest rates on outstanding amounts \\n \\nOutstanding  amounts  are  defined  as  the  stock  of  all  deposits  placed  by  households  and  non-\\nfinancial corporations with the reporting agent and the stock of all loans granted by the reporting \\nagent to households and non-financial corporations resident in the euro member states. For this \\npoint-in-time data collection, the reporting agents report a volume-weighted average interest \\nrate for each reporting item in scheme ZA on the last day of the month. It covers all contracts in \\nplace on the reference day.  \\n \\nb) Interest rates and volumes for new business: overnight deposits, deposits redeemable \\nat notice, credit card debt, as well as revolving loans and bank overdrafts \\n \\nFor practical reasons, overnight deposits (items 01 and 07 of scheme ZB), deposits redeemable \\nat notice (items 05 and 06 of scheme ZB), extended credit card debt (items 32 and 36 of scheme \\nZB), as well as revolving loans and overdrafts (items 12 and 23 of scheme ZB) do not show the \\nactual  new  business,  but  rather  the  outstanding  amount  at  the  end  of  the  month.  This  means \\nthat the total outstanding debit/credit balance amount at the end of the month is to be used \\nto create the reporting data for these instrument categories. \\n \\nThe interest rates that are to be reported for overnight deposits, deposits redeemable at notice, \\nextended  credit  card  debt,  as  well  as  revolving  loans  and  bank  overdrafts,  reflect  the  volume-\\nweighted  average  interest  level  at  the  end  of  the  month  for  the  total  outstanding  amount  on \\nthese accounts. It covers the balance sheet positions of all outstanding contracts that have been \\nagreed in all the periods prior to the reference date.  \\n \\n\\nTo  calculate the  interest  rates  on  accounts that can  either  be  a loan or deposit,  depending  on \\ntheir balance, reporting agents distinguish between the periods with a credit balance and the pe-\\nriods with a debit balance. The reporting agents report weighted average interest rates referring \\nto the credit balances as overnight deposits and weighted average interest rates referring to \\nthe debit balances as overdrafts.  \\n\\nSee the monthly balance sheet statistics guidelines for credit card debt and revolving loans \\n \\n \\nc) Interest rates and volumes for new business: deposits with an agreed maturity, repos \\nand all loans excluding credit card debt, as well as revolving loans and overdrafts \\n \\nFor deposits with an agreed maturity (items 02 to 04, 08 to 10 of scheme ZB), repos (item 11 of \\nscheme  ZB)  and all  loans  excluding  extended  credit  card  debt,  as  well  as  revolving  loans and \\noverdrafts  (items  13  to  22,  30  and  31,  33  to  35,  37  to  85  and  88  to  91  of  scheme  ZB),  new \\n\\nPage 7 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\nbusiness is defined as any new agreement between the household or non-financial corporation \\nand the reporting agent in the reference period. New agreements comprise: \\n \\n\\ni) \\n\\nii) \\n\\nall financial contracts that specify the interest rate of the deposit or loan for the first \\ntime, and \\nall renegotiations of existing deposits and loans. \\n\\n \\n \\nRenegotiations within the meaning of ii) require the active involvement of the household or non-\\nfinancial corporation in adjusting the terms and conditions of an existing deposit or loan contract \\n(including the interest rate). \\nTacit agreement is also considered to be “active involvement”. \\n \\nFor  the  separate  reporting  of  renegotiated  loans  to  households  or  non-financial  corporations \\n(items 88 to 91 of scheme ZB) only loans that have been granted but not yet repaid at the time \\nthey are renegotiated are to be included. \\nIn  case  of  purchased  or  transferred  existing  loans  and  leasing  claims  from  other  MFIs,  the \\nreceiving  credit  institution  has  to  report  these  as  renegotiated  loans  if  renegotiations  of  terms \\nand conditions took place with the debtors of the acquired claims, otherwise the purchase is only \\nshown in outstanding amounts. If loan and leasing claims are purchased from  non-MFIs, these \\nclaims are to be reported as new business but not as renegotiated loans. \\n \\nAs  part  of  a  merger  between  credit  institutions,  the  merged  partner’s  old  outstanding  amounts \\nare  only  to  be  shown  in  the  outstanding  amounts  and  do  not  represent  new  business  for  the \\npurposes  of  the  interest  rate  statistics  as  long  as  no  renegotiations  of  the  conditions  with  the \\nmerged institution’s customers took place.  \\n \\nChanges  to  the  loan  or  deposit  amount  of  existing  contracts  for  the  remaining  maturity  which \\nwere  not  foreseen  when  the  contract  was  concluded,  but  are  a  result  of  renegotiations,  are \\nshown as new business with the amount outstanding plus the increased amount. Additionally the \\namount outstanding (without the increased amount) is to be shown in renegotiated loans (items \\n88  to  91  of  scheme  ZB).    However,  a  reduction  of  the  loan  or  deposit  amount  is  not  to  be \\nreported as negative new business. \\n \\nNo  new  agreements  exist  in  the  following  cases,  i.e.  they  are  not  to  be  considered  in  the \\ninterest rates and volumes for new business, but only in the interest rates for the outstanding \\namounts. \\n \\n– Prolongations  of  existing  deposit  and loan  contracts  that  occur  automatically,  i.e.  without  the \\nactive  involvement  of  the  household  or  non-financial  corporation  and  do  not  involve  a \\nrenegotiation of the terms and conditions of the contract (including the interest rate). “Without \\nthe active involvement of the customer” means that the interest rate is adjusted automatically \\naccording to a rule laid down in the agreement without customer intervention.  \\n\\n \\n– Changes  in  floating  interest  rates  due  to  automatic  interest  rate  adjustments  (agreed  in \\n\\nadvance) by the reporting agent.  \\n\\n \\n– A  change from  a fixed  to a floating  interest rate  or  vice versa  which  has  been  agreed at  the \\n\\nstart of the contract (time t0). \\n\\n \\n– If only the collateral of a loan is changed during the new negotiations, and this has no effect on \\n\\nthe interest rates or loan amount, this change is not to be considered as new business. \\n\\nPage 8 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\n \\n–  Loans  where  the  customer  has  not  accepted  any  interest  rate  offer  before  the  expiry  of  the \\nextension  period  and  which  have  therefore  been  transferred  to  a  temporary  rate  are  to  be \\nentered in the  outstanding  amounts  (scheme  ZA)  with the  temporary  interest  rate;  this  is  not \\nnew business.  \\n\\n \\nProlongations which were not agreed at the start of the contract (t0) and which are concluded \\nfor  a  future  date  (t2)  are  to  be  shown  at  the  time  the  renewal  is  concluded  (t1)  with  the  newly \\nagreed terms as new business and as renegotiated loans (items 88 to 91 of scheme ZB). The \\nconditions granted in t1 for t2 are incorporated into the report via the outstanding amounts in t2.  \\n \\nIf a loan (as long as it is not credit card debt, a revolving loan or overdraft) is not taken out in full \\nat the start of the contract, but rather in tranches at various points in time (t0, t1,...,tn ), then this \\nloan is covered only once as new business with the full loan amount at the time the agree-\\nment  is  concluded.  The  individual  tranches  are  to  be  included  in  the  outstanding  amounts  in \\nthose  months  in  which  they  are  paid  out.

At the  booking  cut-off  date on  the  last  day  of the \\nreference  month,  the  interest  rates  are  to  be  calculated  as  volume-weighted  averages  of  the \\ninterest  rates  which  are  applied  for  the  total  stock  of  deposits  and  loans.  At  this  date,  the \\nreporting agent has to calculate the corresponding interest rates and volumes for all outstanding \\ndeposits  and  loans  vis-à-vis  households  and  non-financial  corporations  and  to  compile  a \\nweighted  average  interest  rate  for  each  instrument  category.  The  interest  rates  for  the \\noutstanding  amounts  only  cover  contracts  that  are  still  outstanding  at  the  time  of  the  data \\ncollection. \\n \\nb)  Time  reference  point  for  interest  rates  and  volumes  for  new  business:  overnight \\ndeposits, deposits redeemable at notice, extended credit card debt, as well as revolving \\nloans and overdrafts. \\n \\nThe new business interest rates for overnight deposits (items 01 and 07 of scheme ZB), deposits \\nredeemable at notice (items 05 and 06 of scheme ZB), extended credit card debt (items 32 and \\n36 of scheme ZB), as well as revolving loans and overdrafts (items 12 and 23 of scheme ZB) are \\nto be compiled as a snapshot of end-period observations.  \\n \\nThe  reported  interest  rates  are  to  be  calculated  as  volume-weighted  averages  of  the  interest \\nrates applied to the total stock of deposits and loans of these specific instrument categories at \\nthe booking cut-off date on the last day of the reporting month. At this date, the reporting agent \\nhas to collect the corresponding interest rates and volumes for all overnight deposits, deposits \\nredeemable at notice, extended credit card debt, as well as revolving loans and bank overdrafts \\nvis-à-vis households and non-financial corporations, and to compile a weighted average interest \\nrate for each instrument category. The interest rates and volumes only cover contracts that are \\nstill outstanding at the time of the data collection. \\n \\nFor  accounts  that  can  either  be  a deposit  or  a  loan,  a differentiation  has  to  be  made  between \\nmonths with credit  balances and  months  with debit  balances.  Only  the  balance at  the  booking \\ncut-off date on the last day of the month determines whether the account is an overnight deposit \\nor an overdraft in that month. \\n \\nc) Time reference period for interest rates and volumes for new business: deposits with \\nagreed  maturity,  repos  and  all  loans  excluding  extended  credit  card  debt  as  well  as \\nrevolving credits and overdrafts \\n \\nThe new business interest rates for deposits with an agreed maturity (items 02 to 04, 08 to 10 of \\nscheme ZB), repos (item 11 of scheme ZB) and all loans excluding extended credit card debt as \\nwell  as  revolving  loans  and  overdrafts  (items  13  to  22,  33  to  35,  37  to  85,  and  88  to  91  of \\nscheme ZB), are to be calculated as average values for the entire reporting month.  \\n \\nFor  each  of  these  instrument  categories,  the  reported  interest  rate  is  to  be  calculated  as  a \\nvolume-weighted  average  of  the  interest  rates  of  all  new  business  cases  during  the  reference \\nmonth in the relevant category. These weighted average interest rates are to be transmitted to \\nthe  Bundesbank  together  with  the  amount  of  new  business  conducted  during  the  reporting \\nmonth for  each instrument  category. The  report covers  all  new  business  conducted  during the \\nentire  month.  Therefore,  operations  which  start  and  end  within  the  reporting  period  are  to  be \\nreported as new business, whereas they are not relevant for the outstanding amounts because \\nof  the month-end  analysis.  As  a general  rule, the contract  date is the  determining factor  when \\ncategorising the new business to a reporting month. \\n\\nPage 10 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\n \\nAll  renegotiations  of  existing  deposit  or  loan  contracts  must  be  taken  into  account  as  new \\nbusiness, even if the same contract is renegotiated more than once during the reference period. \\n \\nAgreements  that  are  subject  to  a  suspensive  condition  pursuant  to  section  158  (1)  of  the \\nGerman  Civil  Code,  e.g.  that  still  require  approval  from  the  credit  committee,  are  only  to  be \\ncovered  as  new  business  in  the  interest  rate  statistics  after  they  have  fulfilled  the  suspensive \\ncondition  (approval).  Agreements  which  have  been  granted  to  the  customer,  but  still  require \\napproval by the customer, are only to be covered as new business by the reporting agent after \\nthe signed agreement has been received. \\n \\n \\n4. Instrument categories \\n \\na) Preliminary remarks \\n \\nWhen  calculating  interest  rate  statistical  data  for  the  outstanding  amounts  and  new  business, \\nonly  deposits  and  loans  denominated  in  euro  are  to  be  covered,  pursuant  to  the  reporting \\nscheme. As a general rule, all products that fall within an instrument category are to be taken \\ninto  account.  Exceptions  to  this  rule  include  bad  loans6  and  loans  for  debt  restructuring  at \\ninterest rates below market conditions; neither are these to be included in the calculation of the \\naverage weighted interest rates for the outstanding amounts nor in the new business. Offsetting \\nis to be processed according to the balance sheet statistics framework (see III. General reporting \\nrules and other explanatory notes; Offsetting). \\n \\nOnly  on  balance  sheet  transactions  are  to  be  included  in  the  interest  rate  statistics.  The \\nexceptions  to  this  are  forward  operations  and  irrevocable  lending  commitments  with  condition \\nagreements which are only to be included as new business in interest rate statistics’ at the time \\nthe agreement is signed or when the agreement conditions have been newly negotiated. From \\nthe  time  of  the  debiting  and  crediting,  these  exceptions  are  to  be  accounted  for  in  the \\noutstanding amounts in line with their original maturity.7  \\n \\nAs a general rule, all deposit and loan categories require a sectoral breakdown. Here has to be \\ndistinguished between indicators vis-à-vis households (including sole proprietors as well as non-\\nprofit  institutions  serving  households)  and  vis-à-vis  non-financial  corporations.  Data  for  sole \\nproprietors  are  to  be  shown  as  an  “of  which”-item  under  households  (item  33  to  35  of  the \\nreporting  scheme  ZB)  for  the  new  business  category  “loans  for  other  purposes”.  For  the  new \\nbusiness  of  loans  (excluding  extended  credit  card  debt  as  well  as  revolving  loans  and \\noverdrafts), data for renegotiated loans are to be reported as an “of which”-item for the sum of \\nrenegotiated  loans  to  households  depending  on  their  purpose  (items  88  to  90  of  scheme  ZB) \\nand for the sum of all loans to non-financial corporations (item 91 of scheme ZB). No sectoral \\nbreakdown is required for repos (item 05 of scheme ZA as well as item 11 of scheme ZB) and \\ndeposits  redeemable  at  notice  (items  05  and  06  of  scheme  ZB).  There  is  no  differentiation \\ninstrument \\nbetween  households  and  non-financial  corporations \\ncategories.  \\n \\n\\nthe  aforementioned \\n\\nin \\n\\n                                                 \\n6 Reporting agents have discretionary scope in determining which loans are to be classified as non-performing ac-\\n\\ncording to internal criteria. For consistency and simplicity, the definition pursuant to the Liquidity Regulation (Liquid-\\nitätsverordnung) can be chosen (loans for which individual value adjustments have been made, provided that they \\nare currently impaired). \\n\\n7 See also Monthly balance sheet statistics, General guidelines, II. Maturity classification.  \\n\\nPage 11 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\nUnless otherwise stated in the paragraphs below, the instrument breakdown for the purposes of \\nthe  interest  rate  statistics  and  the  definitions  of  the  types  of  instruments  follow  the  asset  and \\nliability categories set out in Annex II part 2 of Regulation ECB/2013/33 of 24 September 2013 \\nconcerning  the  balance  sheet  of  the  monetary  financial  institutions  sector  (OJ  L  297,  7 \\nNovember 2013) and the monthly balance sheet statistics guidelines.  \\n \\n \\nb) Notes on selected deposit categories \\n \\nNo  maturity  breakdown  is  required  for  repos  (item  05  of  scheme  ZA  as  well  as  item  11  of \\nscheme ZB) as they are assumed to be predominantly very short-term. In addition, for repos no \\nsectoral  breakdown  is  required,  but  repos  rather  relate  to  households  and  non-financial \\ncorporations without differentiation. \\n \\nFor  repos  see  also  III.  General  reporting  rules  and  other  explanatory  notes,  sales  and  repurchase \\ntransactions, securities and precious metal lending transactions  \\n \\nOvernight deposits (items 01 and 07 of scheme ZB) cover all overnight deposits whether or \\nnot  they  are  interest  bearing.  Prepaid  money  card  amounts  and  amounts  connected  with \\nsoftware-supported electronic money are also to be taken into account. Overnight deposits are \\ncompiled analogously to the outstanding amounts at the end of the reference month. Therefore \\nthey  are  not  to  be  included  in  the  interest  rate  calculation  for  the  outstanding  amounts  of \\ndeposits  of  households or  non-financial  corporations  with agreed maturities  of  up  to two  years \\n(items 01 and 03 of scheme ZA). \\n \\nNon-financial  corporations’  deposits redeemable  at  notice8  are  to  be  compiled  together  with \\nthose of households (including non-profit institutions serving households). Deposits redeemable \\nat a notice of 3 months before the end of the quarter are to be categorised under the maturity \\nbreakdown \"of over 3 months\" (item 06 of scheme ZB). \\n \\n \\nc) General notes on the loan categories \\n \\nFor  the  purposes  of  interest  rate  statistics,  revolving  loans  are  defined  as  in  the  guidelines  on \\nmonthly balance sheet statistics.  \\n \\nOverdrafts are debit balances on current accounts. The interest rate on overdrafts corresponds \\nwith  the  interest  rate  that  is  charged  to the  account  when  a  credit  balance  (overnight  deposit) \\nbecomes a debit balance (overdraft). This means that the overnight deposits and overdraft relate \\nto the same account. Overdrafts have no fixed maturity9 and are in general granted without the \\ncustomer having to contact the bank in advance before using it. Usually the reporting agent sets \\nan upper limit on the overdraft that the household or non-financial corporation can use. All bank \\noverdrafts are to be included regardless of whether they are within or beyond the limit agreed \\nbetween  the  reporting  agent  and  the  household  or  the  non-financial  corporation.  Overdrafts \\ntherefore  include  approved  overdraft  facilities  and  non-approved  overdrafts,  as  well  as  current \\naccount  credits.  Penalties  on  non-approved  overdrafts  are  only  to  be  included  in  the  reported \\ninterest  rates  if  they  represent  an  interest  component.  If  the  overdraft  penalty  fee  is  a  non-\\ninterest rate related charge, however, it is not covered by the AAR.  \\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n8 See also Monthly balance sheet statistics, General guidelines, II. Maturity classification. \\n9 A limited permission usage of an overdraft is not to be interpreted as a maturity.  \\n\\nPage 12 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\nExtended credit card debt is covered in an own category, and not covered in the revolving loans \\nand overdrafts. The total amount owed by the borrower is to be reported, irrespective of whether \\nit  is  within  or  beyond  any  limit  agreed  beforehand  between  the  lender  and  the  borrower  with \\nregard to the size and/or maximum period of the loan. \\n \\nAs  for  the  interest  rates  for  outstanding  amounts  (scheme  ZA),  the  revolving  loans  and \\noverdrafts generally are to be included in the instrument categories loans for house purchase or \\nloans  for  consumption  and  other  purposes  to  households  as  well  as  loans  to  non-financial \\ncorporations depending on their purpose and sectoral classification. Each of them is covered by \\noriginal maturity of up to 1 year (items 06, 09 and 12 of scheme ZA). If a clear classification in \\ninstrument categories is not possible, loans can be classified according to the monthly balance \\nsheet  statistics,  general  guidelines,  III.  General  reporting  rules  and  other  explanatory  rules  – \\ninstrument  categories.  For  the  data  concerning  the  new  business  (scheme  ZB)  for  revolving \\nloans  and  overdrafts  an  individual  instrument  category  is  included  (positions  12  and  23  of \\nscheme ZB). Loans reported under this category are not reported under any other new business \\ncategory. \\n \\n \\nExample 4: Reporting overdrafts \\n \\nAt  the  end  of  the  month,  the  current  account  in  question  has  a  debit  balance  of  €1000.  It  is \\nassumed that the overdraft was granted to the customer (a household) for consumer purposes. \\nAn interest rate of 12% is charged (with annual interest capitalisation). The following data are to \\nbe included in the report to the Bundesbank for this transaction:  \\n \\nNew business (scheme ZB) \\nScheme, item number / interest rate / volumes \\nZB, item 12 / 12.0000% / €1000 \\n \\nThe classification of various card products in the MFI-interest rate statistics is determined mainly \\nby the provisions governing the balance sheet statistics.10 \\n \\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  interest  rate  statistics,  credit  card  debt  has  the  same  meaning  as \\n“credit card debt” in Annex II part 2 of regulation ECB/2013/33 and in the general guidelines on \\nthe monthly balance sheet statistics. \\n \\nOnly  the  interest  rates  related  to  extended  credit  card  debt  have  to  be  reported  as  new \\nbusiness  (items  32  and  36  of  scheme  ZB).  The  interest  rate  for  convenience  credit  is  not \\nreported  separately,  as  it  is  by  definition  0%.  However,  the  outstanding  convenience  and \\nextended  credit  card  debt  are  together  included  on  outstanding  amounts  according  to  the \\nsectoral classification in the maturity breakdown with the shortest original maturity in the portfolio \\nitems  (items  09  and  12  of  scheme  ZA).11  Neither  extended  credit  card  debt  nor  convenience \\ncredit card debt is reported under any other new business indicator.  \\n \\nLoan  amounts  that  can  be  called  with  cards  counting  as  debit  cards  and  have  to  be  retired  in \\npreviously  agreed  rates  (debit  cards  with  payment  and  credit  function)  are  to  be  reported \\n\\nOutstanding amounts (scheme ZA) \\nScheme, item number / interest rate \\nZA, item 09 / 12.0000% \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n10 For information on the classification of cards into debit cards and credit cards, see Monthly balance sheet statistics, \\n\\nGeneral guidelines, III.

For  the  classification  according  to  the \\npurpose of the loan – for outstanding amounts and new business – the rules for revolving credits \\nand overdrafts as well as credit card debt shall apply.13 \\n \\nExtended  credit  card  debt,  convenience  credit  card  debt,  as  well  as  revolving  loans  and \\noverdrafts  are  to  be  included  in  the  interest  rate  calculation  of  outstanding  amounts  with  an \\noriginal maturity of up to 1 year depending on their purpose and sectoral classification (item 06, \\n09 and 12 of scheme ZA).14 \\n \\nFor the purposes of the interest rate statistics, all secured and unsecured loans together (items \\n06 to 08 and 15 to 20 of scheme ZA as well as items 16 to 19, 31 and 89 of scheme ZB) and \\nseparately  only  the  secured  loans15  which  have  been  granted  for  investing  in  housing \\n(including house construction and modernisation) (items 58 to 61 of scheme ZB) are to be \\ncompiled as housing loans to households. However, please note that for new business, any \\nrevolving loans and overdrafts are to be shown separately and must not be included in the loans \\nto  households  for  housing  with  a  floating  rate  and  up  to  1  year  period  of  initial  rate  fixation \\n(position 16 of scheme ZB). \\n \\nLoans to households for consumption (items 09 to 11 and 15 to 20 of scheme ZA as well as \\nitems  13 to 15,  30  and 55  to  57  as  well  as  88 of  scheme  ZB)  are  loans  that  are  granted for \\npersonal  use  in  the  consumption  of  goods  and  services.  In  new  business,  secured  and \\nunsecured loans together (items 13 to 15 and 30 of scheme ZB) and only secured loans (items \\n55 to 57 of scheme ZB) are compiled separately.16 Loans for consumption include, in particular, \\nloans  to  households  for  purchasing  durable  goods,  such  as  vehicles,  furniture,  domestic \\nappliance, TV and radio equipment or computers, or to finance a holiday. For interest rates for \\noutstanding amounts (items 09 to 11 of scheme ZA), loans for consumption and other purposes \\nto  households  are  consolidated  in  one  instrument  category.  However,  please  note  that  with \\nrespect to new business, extended credit card debt as well as revolving loans and overdrafts are \\nto  be  shown  separately  and  must  not  be  included  in  the  loans  for  consumption  to  households \\nwith a floating rate and up to 1 year period of initial rate fixation (item 13 of scheme ZB). \\n \\nLoans to households for other purposes (items 09 to 11 and 15 to 20 of scheme ZA as well \\nas  items  20  to  22  and  33  to  35  as  well  as  90  of  scheme  ZB)  are  loans  to  the  household \\nsector,  which  are  not  covered  by  the  aforementioned  categories  (e.g.  loans  for  business \\npurposes,  debt  consolidation,  training  and  further  education).  Extended  credit  card  debt, \\nconvenience credit card debt, as well as revolving loans and overdrafts are to be included with \\nthe  outstanding  amounts  with  an  original  maturity  of  up  to  1  year  (item  09  of  scheme  ZA). \\nHowever, please note that with respect to new business, any extended credit card debt, as well \\nas  revolving  loans and overdrafts  are to be  shown  separately  and must  not  be  included  in the \\nloans to households for other purposes with a floating rate and up to 1 year of initial rate fixation \\n(item 20 of scheme ZB). \\n                                                 \\n12 See II.

These  breakdowns  refer  to  time \\nbands or ranges. For example an interest rate on a deposit with an agreed maturity of up to two \\nyears (items 01 or 03 of scheme ZA) refers to an average rate across all deposits with an agreed \\noriginal maturity between two days and a maximum of two years weighted by size of the deposit \\n(see also 4.b General notes on selected deposit categories; overnight deposits).  \\n \\nThe breakdown by original- and residual maturity as well as period of notice follows the defini-\\ntions  set  out  in  Part  2  of  Annex  II  to  Regulation  ECB/2013/33  or  in  the  general  section  of  the \\nguidelines on monthly balance sheet statistics. A breakdown by original maturity is applied to all \\ndeposit categories other than repos referring to outstanding amounts and all lending categories \\nreferring to outstanding amounts (see scheme ZA). For the loans of outstanding amounts an ad-\\nditional  breakdown  by  original  maturity  in  combination  with  residual  maturity  and  next  interest \\nrate reset  is  required (items  15 to  26  of  scheme  ZA).  A  breakdown by  original  maturity  is  also \\napplied to new business on deposits with agreed maturity and a breakdown by period of notice \\nto new business on deposits redeemable at notice (see scheme ZB). The interest rates for new \\nbusiness on loans are to be classified according to the initial period of rate fixation (see scheme \\nZB). For the purposes of interest rate statistics, the initial period of rate fixation is defined as the \\ninitial period which was agreed at the start of the contract, during which the value of the interest \\nrate will not change. The initial period of rate fixation may be shorter or equal to the original ma-\\nturity period. \\n \\nThe value of the interest rate is only considered to be unchangeable if it is defined as an exact \\nlevel  (e.g.  6%)  or  as  a  differential  to  a  reference  rate  at  a  fixed  point  in  time  (e.g.  6-month \\nEURIBOR  rate  on  31  December  2002  plus  2%).  If  at  the  start  of  the  contract  a  procedure  to \\ncalculate  the  lending  rate  is  agreed  for  a  certain  period  of  time,  however,  such  as  “6-month \\n\\nPage 15 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\nEURIBOR rate plus 2% for three years”, this is not considered to be an initial rate fixation period, \\nas the interest rate level (in line with the reference rate) may change during the three years.17 \\n \\nThe statistics on new business only reflect the interest rate that is agreed for the initial period of \\ninterest  rate  fixation  at  the  start  of  the  agreement  or  as  part  of  a  renegotiation  of  the  loan \\nagreement. If the interest rate automatically changes to a floating rate after the initial period of \\nrate  fixation  (as  agreed  previously),  the  transaction  at  this  point  is  not  to  be  reported  as  new \\nbusiness again, but instead just to be included in the interest rate calculation for the outstanding \\namounts. \\n \\nIn  new  business,  loans  to  households for  which  no  fixed  interest  rate  was  agreed  (i.e.  loans \\nwith  a  variable  interest  rate)  are  to  be  included  in  the  maturity  breakdown  “loans  with  a \\nfloating  rate  or  initial  rate  fixation  up  to  1  year”.  However,  these  types  of  loans  to  non-\\nfinancial corporations are to be included in the maturity breakdown \"loans with floating rate or \\ninitial rate fixation up to 3 months\" according to their size. In addition, loans to non-financial \\ncorporations with a floating rate and initial rate fixation up to 1 year period in connection with an \\noriginal maturity of over 1 year are to be compiled additionally as an “of which” category (items \\n80 to 85 of scheme ZB).  \\n \\n \\nf) Breakdown by secured loans with collateral and/or guarantees \\n \\nThe  reason  for  the  introduction  of  “of  which”  items  for  loans  to  households  and  non-financial \\ncorporations,  showing  only  collateralised  loans,  is  to  break  down  loans  in  new  business  into \\nmore  homogeneous  risk  groups.  The  objective  is  to  improve  the  information  content  of  the \\nstatistics by taking credit risk into account and to allow more in-depth analyses as well as cross-\\ncountry  comparisons.  To  this  end,  all  collateralised  loans  to  households  and  non-financial \\ncorporations  must  be  reported  in  the  relevant  new  business  categories  with  the  exception  of \\ncredit card debt, revolving loans and overdrafts as well as other loans (see items ZB 55 to 79 as \\nwell as 81, 83 and 85 of the reporting scheme for new business). \\n \\nExisting loans which fulfil the definition of new business according to the guidelines on MFI in-\\nterest rate statistics18 and which are therefore to be shown as new business at the time they are \\nrenegotiated have to be checked again to verify whether they count as secured loans in accord-\\nance with the definition above. Thus, it is possible for a loan to change its status over the course \\nof its total maturity.19  \\n \\nFor the purposes of the interest rate statistics, a loan is considered to be secured if collateral in \\nat  least  the  same  value  as  the  loan  amount  has  been  posted,  pledged  or  assigned.  The  total \\nvalue of the collateralisation can be calculated as the sum of all protection instruments provided \\nfor  this  loan  that  can  be  recognised  when  calculating  the  prudential  capital  requirements \\naccording to the respective approach used. The collateral must be taken into account according \\nto the time of the conclusion of the loan agreement, which was concluded on the basis of such \\ncover, even if the collateralisation effect is not yet legally effective at this time. \\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n17 For the definition of new business see II Explanatory notes on the reporting system, 2. c) Interest rates and vol-\\n\\n18 See II. Explanatory notes on the reporting system, 2. c) Interest rates and volumes for new business. \\n19 Thus, the approach for MFI interest rate statistics differs from the original collateralisation principle of the monthly \\n\\numes for new business.  \\n\\nbalance sheet statistics.  \\n\\nPage 16 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\nWhere  the  Credit  Risk  Standardised  Approach  (CRSA)  and  the  Internal  Ratings  Based \\nApproach with supervisory loss given default (F-IRBA) are used, the following collateral is to \\nbe taken for the purposes of the interest rate statistics: \\n \\nfunded credit protection \\n1.  financial  collateral  pursuant  to  article  197  (1  to  6)  and  article  198  under  consideration  of \\n\\narticle 197 (8) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013; \\n\\n2.  real  estate  collateral  according  to  the  specifications  outlined  under  “VII  annex  B5”  in  the \\n\\n“Guidelines on the annexes to the monthly balance sheet statistics”; \\n\\n3.  cash on deposit held with, or a certificate of deposit or similar instrument held by a third-party \\ninstitution in a non-custodial arrangement pursuant to article 200 (a) of this Regulation;  \\n\\n4.  life insurance policies pursuant to article 200 (b) of this Regulation;  \\n5.  debt  securities  which  must  be  repurchased  by  the  issuing  third-party  institution  on  request \\n\\npursuant to article 200 (c) of this Regulation;  \\n\\n \\nWhere the F-IRBA is applied, the following collateral assets are also to be recognised:  \\n1.  IRBA  receivables  assigned  or  pledged  as  collateral  pursuant  to  article  199  (5)  of  this \\n\\n2.  other IRBA physical collateral pursuant to article 199 (6) of this Regulation;  \\n3.  the treatment of lease exposures as collateralised by the leased asset is governed by article \\n\\nRegulation; \\n\\n199 (7) of this Regulation;  \\n \\n\\nunfunded credit protection \\n\\n1.  unfunded  credit  protection  provided  by  eligible  providers  of  unfunded  credit  protection \\n\\npursuant to article 201 (1) of this regulation; article 201 (2) shall apply accordingly;  \\n\\n2.  guarantees pursuant to article 203 of this Regulation \\n3.  for  IRBA  exposures  with  special  recognition  of  unfunded  credit  protection  pursuant  to \\n\\narticle 202 of this Regulation \\n\\n \\n\\nvaluation principles \\nFinancial collateral may be recognised at its market value at most. Real estate collateral must be \\nvalued  according  to  the  specifications  outlined  under  “VII  annex  B5”  in  the  “Guidelines  on  the \\nannexes to the monthly balance sheet statistics”. A cash on deposit held with, or a certificate of \\ndeposit held by a third-party institution has to be assessed at the nominal value of the cash on \\ndeposit or the certificate of deposit. For life insurance policies the surrender value is applicable. \\nDebt securities which must be repurchased by the issuing third-party institution on request are to \\nbe recognised with \\n\\n- \\n- \\n\\nthe nominal value, if the debt security must be repurchased at this value or with \\nthe  value,  with  which  it  would  have  to  be  recognised  as  eligible  financial  collateral  if  it \\nmust be repurchased at the market value. \\n\\n \\nOther  physical  collateral  must  be  valued  at  the  well-established  and  publicly  available  market \\nprices  as  stipulated  in  article  199  (6)(b)  of  this  Regulation.  IRBA  receivables  assigned  as \\ncollateral must be recognised at their book value. The value of a unfunded credit protection is, if \\nit \\n\\n- \\n- \\n\\nis capped  at the maximum value, the maximum value \\nis a guarantee, that does not cover all payments owed by the borrower in the guaranteed \\nposition,  the  value  reduced  by  the  amount  of  the  not  covered  payments  or  maximum \\nvalue of the guarantee. \\n\\n \\nIn  all  other  cases  the  amount,  that  has  to  be  paid  at  the  protection  buying  institution  in  the \\nwarranty case, is recognised. \\n\\nPage 17 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\n \\nFor  institutions  that  calculate  their  capital  requirements  according  to  the  IRBA  using  own \\nestimates of loss given default (A-IRBA), the total value of the collateral is calculated as the \\nsum of all protection instruments provided for this loan that are eligible for use under the A-IRBA. \\nIn terms of the recognition of guarantors, A-IRBA institutions must, pursuant to article 183 (1) of \\nthis Regulation, have clearly specified criteria for the types of guarantors they recognise. Under \\nthe  A-IRBA,  all  protection  instruments  must  be  recognised  at  the  value  determined  (by  the \\ninstitution) that is also the basis of further calculations for the banking supervision. \\n \\nPlease note that at the first time of its provision the classification of a real estate loan must be \\napplied  consistently  for  the  purposes  of  both  the  balance  sheet  statistics  and  the  interest  rate \\nstatistics.  As  a  consequence,  all  newly  granted  loans  that  are  deemed  to  be  secured  by  real \\nestate  for  the  purposes  of  the  monthly  balance  sheet  statistics  must  also  be  reported  as \\ncollateralised in the new business of interest rate statistics. The reverse is not true, however, as \\nthe definition of a collateralised loan differs significantly between the balance sheet statistics and \\nthe interest rate statistics. While only real estate collateral is recognised for the purposes of the \\nbalance sheet statistics, the definition of collateralisation for interest rate statistics includes the \\ncollateral instruments stated above available under prudential regulations. \\n \\n5. Dealing with selected specific products \\n \\na) Step-up/step-down products \\n \\nStep-up/step  down  products  are  predominantly  deposits  and  loans  with  a  fixed  maturity.  The \\ninterest rate for the whole maturity of the deposit or loan and the other terms and conditions are \\nagreed  in  advance  at  time  t0  when  the  contract  is  signed.  Step-up/step-down  products  are \\ndistinguishable by a fixed maturity to which an interest rate is applied that increases (decreases) \\nfrom year to year by a pre-fixed number of percentage points.  \\n \\nExample 5: Calculation of interest rate for step-up/step-down products \\n \\nFor Step-up/step-down products, it is recommended to calculate the interest rate based on the \\nnarrowly defined effective rate (NDER) as this enables the “interest rate levels” to be taken into \\nconsideration  on  an  accrual  basis.  The  interest  rate  can  also  be  calculated  provisionally  as  a \\ngeometric mean in accordance with the following example as a “quasi” annualised agreed rate \\n(AAR). \\n \\nAn  example  of  a  step-up  deposit  is  a  deposit  with  an  agreed  maturity  of  four  years,  which  re-\\nceives 5% interest in the first year, 7% in the second, 9% in the third and 13% in the fourth.  \\n \\nThe AAR on new business, which is covered at time t0 in MFI interest rate statistics, is the geo-\\nmetric average of the factors “1 + interest rate” minus 1 and thereby: \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe AAR on outstanding amounts that is covered from time t0 to t3 is the rate applied by the re-\\nporting agent at the time of calculation of the MFI interest rate, i.e. using the example of a de-\\nposit with an agreed maturity of four years 5% at time t0 7% at time t1, 9% at time t2 and 13% at \\ntime t3.  \\n \\n \\n\\nPage 18 of 20 \\n\\n\\uf028\\uf029%.4600.808459976.0113.109.107.105.141\\uf03d\\uf03d\\uf02d\\uf0d7\\uf0d7\\uf0d7\\uf03dx\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\nb) Umbrella contracts \\n \\nAn ‘umbrella contract’ allows the customer to draw loans on several types of loan accounts up to \\na certain maximum amount applying to all loan accounts together. At the time of the agreement \\non  an  umbrella  contract,  the  form  the  loan  will  take  and/or  the  date  at  which  the  loan  will  be \\ndrawn and/or the interest rate are not specified, but a range of possibilities may be agreed. Such \\nan umbrella contract is not covered by MFI interest rate statistics. However, as soon as a loan \\nagreed under an umbrella contract is drawn, it is covered under the corresponding item in MFI \\ninterest rate statistics, both in new business and outstanding amounts. The manner in which the \\nloan is dealt with in the statistics regarding new business depends on the type of account which \\nthe customer has chosen to use for the loan. \\n \\n \\nc) Saving deposits with a basic interest rate plus a fidelity and/or growth premium \\n \\nSaving deposits with a basic interest rate plus a fidelity and/or growth premium may exist. At the \\ntime the deposit is placed, it is not certain whether or not the premium will be paid. The payment \\ndepends  on  the  future  unknown  saving  attitude  of  the  household  or  non-financial  corporation. \\nSuch fidelity or growth premiums are not included in the AAR on new business until the fidelity \\nand/or  growth  premium  has  actually  been  granted  by  the  reporting  agent  (items  05  and  06  of \\nscheme ZB) \\n \\n \\nd) Loans with associated derivative contracts \\n \\nLoans  may  be  offered  to  households  or  non-financial  corporations  with  associated  derivative \\ncontracts,  i.e.  an  interest  rate  swap/cap/floor  etc.  As  a  convention,  such  associated  derivative \\ncontracts shall not be included in the AAR on new business. The AAR on outstanding amounts \\nalways covers the rates applied by the reporting agent at the time of the calculation of MFI inter-\\nest rates. Hence, if such a derivative contract is exercised and the reporting agent adjusts the in-\\nterest rate charged to the household or non-financial corporation, this is reflected in the statistics \\non outstanding amounts.  \\n \\n \\ne) Deposits with fixed or variable interest-bearing components \\n \\nDeposits may be offered comprising two components: a deposit with an agreed maturity to which \\na fixed interest rate is being applied and an embedded derivative with a return that is linked to \\nthe performance of a defined stock exchange index or a bilateral exchange rate. The derivative \\ncomponent  is  subject  to  a  minimum  guaranteed  return.  If  the  maturity  of  both  components  is \\nidentical and if both are reported in the same category, the interest rate for the deposit with an \\nagreed  maturity  and  a  fixed  interest  rate  is  to  be  recorded  as  new  business  as  it  reflects  the \\nagreement between the depositor and the reporting agent and is known at the time the funds are \\nplaced. The return on the other component of the deposit, linked to the performance of a stock \\nexchange index or a bilateral exchange rate, is only known  ex post  when the product matures \\nand  therefore  cannot  be  covered  by  the  new  business  rate.  Hence,  only  the  guaranteed  mini-\\nmum  return  is  covered.  The  AAR  on  outstanding  amounts  always  covers  the  interest  rate  ap-\\nplied by the reporting agent at the time of the calculation of MFI interest rates.  Until the day of \\nmaturity, the rate on the deposit with agreed maturity is captured as well as the guaranteed min-\\nimum return on the deposit containing the embedded derivative. Only at maturity do the MFI in-\\nterest  rates  on  outstanding  amounts  reflect  the  AAR  that  is  paid  by  the  reporting  agent.  If  the \\nmaturity of both components differs and the components pertain to different categories then the \\n\\nPage 19 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0cDEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK \\n\\ninterest rate to be reported in each new business category is the combined, volume-weighted in-\\nterest rate of both components. The AAR on outstanding amounts always covers the combined \\ninterest rate applied by the reporting agent at the time of the calculation of MFI interest rates. If \\none component matures, the combined interest rate is no longer applied, but rather the interest \\nrate for the remaining component. \\n \\nIf no minimum return is agreed for the derivative instrument and the depositor participates in all \\nfluctuations of the reference value, meaning, for example, that the interest rate rises in line with \\nstock prices and that the depositor may lose part of the invested capital if stock prices fall, there \\nis no need to report the contract as a whole because it does not form part of the MFI interest rate \\nstatistics owing to the capital uncertainty.    \\n \\nf) Repo savings accounts \\n \\nDeposits with a maturity of over two years may include pension savings accounts (see Annex II \\npart 2 of regulation ECB/2013/33). The main part of the pension saving accounts may be placed \\nin securities.  The  remaining  part  of the  pension  saving  accounts  may  be held in  cash  and the \\ninterest rate is determined by the reporting agent in the same way as for other deposits. At the \\ntime the deposit is placed, no interest rate is agreed between the household and the reporting \\nagent for the part invested in securities. An interest rate is only set for the remaining part of the \\ndeposit. Therefore, only the part of the deposit that is not invested in securities is to be included \\nin the interest rate statistics. The interest rate to be reported for new business is the rate agreed \\nbetween the household and reporting agent at the time the deposit is placed for the part of the \\ndeposit  not  invested  in  securities.  The  interest  rate  for  the  outstanding  amounts  is  the  rate \\napplied by the reporting agent on the deposit part of the pension savings account at the time of \\nthe interest rate calculation. \\n \\n \\ng) Saving plans for housing loans \\n \\nSaving plans for housing loans are long-term saving schemes that may provide a low return but, \\nafter  a  certain  period  of  saving,  give  the  household  or  non-financial  corporation  the  right  to  a \\nhousing  loan  at  a  discounted  rate.  Following  Part  2  of  Annex  II  to  Regulation  ECB/2013/33, \\nthese  savings  plans  are  classified  under  deposits  with  agreed  maturity  over  two  years  as \\nlong as they are used as a deposit. As soon as they are transformed into a loan, they are classi-\\nfied as housing loans to households. Reporting agents report as new deposit business the in-\\nterest rate that is agreed at the time the initial deposit is placed. The corresponding amount of \\nnew business is the amount of money that has been placed. The increase of this amount on the \\ndeposit over time is only covered by the outstanding amounts. At the time when the deposit is \\ntransformed into a loan, this new loan is recorded as new lending business. The interest rate is \\nthe discounted rate that is being offered by the reporting agent. The weight is the total amount of \\nthe loan that is being granted to the household or non-financial corporation.  \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPage 20 of 20 \\n\\n\\x0c'"
